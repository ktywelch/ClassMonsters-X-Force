# Class Heroes!!

## Description
A webapp using API's to design and create an application that can be used in a classroom setting that allows kids to participate more fully through use of comic characters. It was important to make sure that the users can fulfill the Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities(C.R.U.D.). Students can now message their teachers if they need help or is stuck on an assignment. They will be able to update their emergency contacts, what they prefer to be called in class, and also update their feelings for the day. Teachers will be able to record students feelings data as well as emailing parents for any reasons.
